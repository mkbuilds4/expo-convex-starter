# React Native styling

- Use `StyleSheet.create()` for style objects; keep styles next to the component or in the same file.
- Prefer theme and shared components over local StyleSheets for colors, spacing, and typography.
- Use the `style` prop for one-off overrides; pass theme values (e.g. `spacing.lg`) not raw numbers when overriding layout.
- For new UI, import from `./components` and `./lib/theme`; avoid redefining the same colors or dimensions that already exist in the theme.
